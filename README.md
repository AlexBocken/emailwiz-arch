# emailwiz-arch

Set up a minimal email server on Arch Linux with a single script.
This script is largely based off of Luke's emailwiz for Debian: [emailwiz](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/emailwiz).

Small changes were made to the script to make it work on Arch Linux.

# NOTE

You need to fill the value of **$domain** as outlined in the script.
